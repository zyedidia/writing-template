INSTALLATION:
  1.  Decide where you will be installing the .m4 library files. In
      principle, they can go anywhere; for example, $HOME/texmf/Circuit_macros,
      c:\localtexmf\Circuit_macros, /usr/local/share/Circuit_macros,
      or ~/texmf/tex/latex/Circuit_macros.  Copy the files from the
      top-level directory of the distribution to the installation
      directory, or simply expand the .tar.gz or .zip distribution file
      and rename the result to create the installation directory, which
      will then include the doc and examples subdirectories.

  2.  Copy boxdims.sty (see Section 9 of the manual) from the top
      distribution directory to where LaTeX will find it; directory
      ~/texmf/tex/latex/boxdims for example, and refresh the LaTeX
      filename database (the exact command depends on your LaTeX
      distribution and may not be necessary).

  3.  Define the environment variable M4PATH to point to the installation
      directory determined in Step 1. For the bash shell, for
      example, add the following to your .bashrc file:
      export M4PATH='.:~/texmf/tex/latex/Circuit_macros:'
      but modify the path to the installation directory as necessary.

  4.  This is optional. For historical reasons, the default configuration file
      as distributed is gpic.m4. You can change it to pgf.m4 or pstricks.m4
      for use with dpic by editing the include command near the top of
      libgen.m4.  To do this automatically, go to the installation directory
      and type
        "make pgfdefault" to set the default processor to dpic with Tikz pgf
        "make psdefault"  to set the default processor to dpic with PSTricks
        "make gpicdefault" to restore gpic as the default.

  You might develop your own set of macros that are combinations
  or variations of those provided here.  You can put them in a file,
  mymacros.m4 say, and copy it to the installation directory.  Then the
  line include(mymacros.m4) in a diagram source will you make your
  macros available.

  In case of difficulty, go to the examples directory, look at debug1.tex
  and debug2.m4, and follow instructions.

TESTING:
  To test your installation, go to the examples directory (or copy the
  files Makefile, tst.tex, and any .m4 sources you might like to test
  to a working directory) and create a test circuit in the
  file test.m4.  Copy ex01.m4, for example, or quick.m4 from the doc
  directory into test.m4.

  On a system with a "make" facility, first check the definitions at
  the top of the Makefile, and then type "make tst1" to produce the
  file tst.ps.  If the source requires processing twice, type "make
  tst" instead.  To process one of the example .m4 files in the
  examples directory, simply type "make name.ps" to process name.m4.
  If these tests work to your satisfaction, try typing simply "make" to
  produce examples.ps.  To test .pdf files, go to the pgf directory,
  copy name.m4 there, and type either "make name.ps" or "make name.pdf"
  to test the file under pdflatex and TikZ PGF.

  The .m4 files in the examples directory can serve as models for your
  diagrams but keep in mind that some of them contain details that allow
  the source to be used with a variety of postprocessors. Sticking to one
  postprocessor such as tikz or PStricks allows for the simplest source.
  You might also wish to browse some of the included files that are not
  used to make examples.ps.

  A few of the sources in the examples directory are copies of files
  from the doc directory.  They are duplicated to provide flexibility
  of directory structure and independency of sources.

  No "make" facility?  You have to test by hand (but see below for
  diagram production software).  Copy a test file as above into
  test.m4.  Assuming you have dpic installed, type the following:

  m4 -I <path> pstricks.m4 test.m4 > test.pic
  dpic -p test.pic > test.tex
  latex tst
  dvips tst -o tst.ps
